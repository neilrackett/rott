# Rise of the Triad

Atari ST and WebAssembly (WASM) ports by [Neil Rackett](https://x.com/neilrackett)

## Introduction

What better way to celebrate the 30th-ish anniversary of ROTT than to port it to a hardware platform currently celebrating its 40th: Welcome to _Rise of the Triad for Atari ST_ (and TT and WebAssembly).

## Rise of the Triad for the web (WebROTT?)

After creating the Atari ST and TT versions of ROTT, I thought it was only fair that I should create a version for those of you that, for whatever crazy reason, don't own any of Atari's late-80s or early-90s hardware.

Welcome to WebROTT: all of the original features, no installation required.

## Installation

Click on the link above. Play the game. That's it.

## Build

The WebAssembly version of ROTT is built using [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/).

- Install the shareware version of ROTT for DOS using DOSbox (or [download the files from Internet.org](https://archive.org/details/rott_shareware))
- Create a `tmp` folder in the root of this project
- Copy the `ROTT` folder you installed the DOS version into to the `tmp` folder (the actual folder, not just the contents)
- Run `make`

All of the files you need to deploy WebROTT will be in the `build/wasm` folder.
